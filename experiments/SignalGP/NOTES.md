## Notes
- Testcase problems
  - Currently, reward scheme doesn't make sense for some testcase problems. 
  - Also, some testcase problems are incredibly difficult because we can't loop over an input vector. 
    - SOLUTION: give hardware solving testcase problem a circular input vector they can access.
