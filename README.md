### Abstract

> MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven valuable for
> exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational problem.
> In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic traits of prospective
> solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits and maintains only
> the most fit organism found with those traits.  The resulting map of trait combinations
> to fitness allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each trait relates
> to fitness and how they interact with each other.  While MAP-Elites has not been 
> demonstrated to be competitive for identifying the optimal Pareto front, the insights
> it provide do allow the users to better understand the underlying problem.  
> Such insights extend into the underlying structure of the problem representations, 
> such as the value of connection cost or modularity to evolving neural networks.  
> Here, we extend the use of MAP-Elites to examine genetic programming representations, 
> using aspects of program architecture as traits to explore.  We further discuss 
> how this approach can promote more complex and efficient solutions.

## Computational Substrate

In this work, we evolved simple linear genetic programs.
See the publication for a fully detailed description of the linear GP representation
used. 

Details about the instruction set used in our experiments can be found...
